Welcome to the **Hydrosystems Operations, Resilience, and Adaptation (HORA) Lab**. I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), specializing in computational hydrology, machine learning, and climate science.

My research bridges artificial intelligence and hydrological science — developing cutting-edge frameworks that integrate deep learning, satellite remote sensing, and physics-based modeling to address global water challenges. With expertise in large-scale hydrological processes, I focus on improving predictions of water availability, managing drought and flood risks, and building AI-driven solutions for transboundary water resource management under climate change.

My current initiatives include potable water sustainability, adaptive resilience in water infrastructure, advanced hydrological modeling with the E3SM earth system model, and AI-driven transboundary river solutions for some of the world's most contested river basins.
