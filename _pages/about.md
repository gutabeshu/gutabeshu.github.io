Welcome to Hydrosystems Operations, Resilience, and Adaptation (HORA) Lab. I am a researcher specializing in hydrology, machine learning, and environmental sustainability. My work integrates AI/ML technologies with physics-based models to solve global challenges in water resource management and infrastructure resilience. With expertise in hydrological modeling and water resources management, my research aims to improve our understanding of global water sustainability, resilience and climate adaptation. My current initiatives focus on potable water sustainability, adaptive resilience in water infrastructure, advanced hydrological modeling, and AI-driven transboundary river solutions to address critical issues related to water and climate in the 21st century.

<!-- I earned my PhD in Political Science from the
[University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) and my
BA in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu).
My academic work has been [published](publications) in the
*American Political Science Review*, *International Studies Quarterly*,
*Conflict Management and Peace Science*, and
*Political Science Research and Methods*, among other outlets. This
[research](research) explores the causes and consequences of political violence
using a broad variety of methods such as latent variable models, geospatial
analysis, and big data. I have [taught](teaching) quantitative methodology and
international relations, and am a certified instructor with
[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org). -->
